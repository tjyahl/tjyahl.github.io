      <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
      <p>
	My teaching philosophy is that students prosper in an environment that allows them to confidently learn and apply mathematics, without fear of failure or ridicule. In my various roles as mathematics tutor, TA, and instructor, I've taught a wide range of topics from lower-level undergraduate courses through graduate level topics courses. In each of these settings, I've found success by actively engaging with students and allowing them to explore and understand the material in their own way. Several past students have voiced their appreciation for my style of teaching through course evaluations and by reaching out personally. Classroom evaluations from students are available on request from appropriate parties, below are selected comments from these evaluations:

	  "Having a class with Professor Yahl has truly been an honor. He is a phenomenal professor and a very genuine person. Not only does he show up to class eager to teach the content with a smile on his face, but he does so in a way that makes attending class something that I look forward to each day. He is easy to talk to, and is willing to help anyone out if they have any questions about the content. He is one of, if not THE, best professor I have ever had, and he has inspired me to continue pursuing an education in mathematics. Thank you for a great semester!" - Math 320 Student at UW-Madison

	  "He was very calm and the way he taught the material was very refreshing. Compared to other math professors I have had at UW Madison, Thomas has by far been the best professor I have had. He was very knowledgeable of all of the material, and always responded to questions with a thoughtful answer that cleared up any confusion. I also went to his office hours many times, and he could always explain concepts to me very well and could see where I went wrong. He is very nice and cares about his students a substantial amount." - Math 213 Student at UW-Madison

	  "Professor Yahl taught this class very thoroughly and communicated complicated concepts at a level which was very considerate of his students. He allocated appropriate amounts of time for the more complex ideas in the course while also ensuring that students understood the basics and groundwork necessary for success in the class. I would gladly take his class again." - Math 213 Student at UW-Madison

      <h3><u>Real Geometry in Macaulay2</u></h3>
      <p>
	This project led to the development of the <a href="https://macaulay2.com/doc/Macaulay2/share/doc/Macaulay2/RealRoots/html/index.html">RealRoots.m2</a> Macaulay2 package. This package implements several symbolic methods from real algebraic geometry including:
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Variational methods for enumerating the number of real solutions to a system of polynomial equations, such as the Budan-Fourier Theorem, Sturm's Theorem, and Sylvester's Theorem.</li>
	  <li>Ideal theoretic methods for enumerating the number of real solutions to a system of polynomial equations via regular representations and the trace form.</li>
	  <li>Isolation methods for estimating the real zeros of a univariate polynomial via a bisection algorithm.
	</ul>
      <p>
	This work also resulted in an improved statement and proof of Sylvester's theorem, which allows one to compute information about the real zeros of a polynomial system more accurately. The article <a href="https://msp.org/jsag/2024/14-1/jsag-v14-n1-p10-s.pdf#10TITLEPAGE"><em>"Real Solutions to Systems of Polynomial Equations in Macaulay2"</em></a> provides a complete description of the implemented methods and mathematical content.
	<br>
	<br>
	We illustrate the utility of this package via an example. It is well known that a smooth cubic surface in <b>complex</b> projective 3-space contains 27 distinct lines, that lie entirely on the surface. However, a smooth cubic surfaces in <b>real</b> projective 3-space can contain only 3, 7, 15, or 27 lines. By describing these lines as solutions of a polynomial system, the RealRoots.m2 package can be used to determine this number of lines for a given cubic surface. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The illustration below is of the cubic surface defined by the equation
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
	<sup>58313</sup>/<sub>630</sub> x<sup>3</sup> + <sup>13351</sup>/<sub>1260</sub> x<sup>2</sup>y - <sup>2645</sup>/<sub>84</sub> xy<sup>2</sup> + <sup>1997</sup>/<sub>180</sub> y<sup>3</sup> + <sup>1869</sup>/<sub>20</sub> x<sup>2</sup>z + <sup>769</sup>/<sub>105</sub> xyz - <sup>323</sup>/<sub>90</sub> y<sup>2</sup>z - <sup>27</sup>/<sub>20</sub> xz<sup>2</sup> - <sup>4751</sup>/<sub>90</sub> yz<sup>2</sup> + <sup>12053</sup>/<sub>630</sub> z<sup>3</sup> + <sup>1073</sup>/<sub>120</sub> x<sup>2</sup> - <sup>883</sup>/<sub>120</sub> xy - <sup>977</sup>/<sub>252</sub> y<sup>2</sup> - <sup>8737</sup>/<sub>504</sub> xz + <sup>2171</sup>/<sub>360</sub> yz + <sup>541</sup>/<sub>8</sub> z<sup>2</sup> + <sup>1079</sup>/<sub>210</sub> x - <sup>30977</sup>/<sub>1260</sub> y - <sup>36767</sup>/<sub>630</sub> z - <sup>6953</sup>/<sub>1260</sub> = 0.
      </p>
      <p>
	At a glance, it is unclear how many lies lie on this cubic surface. Using RealRoots.m2, it can be proven that the cubic surface below contains the maximum number, 27 lines. These lines are illustrated on the surface below in red. Please click on the figure below for an interactive view of the surface and all 27 lines.

      <h3><u>Cox Homotopies in julia</u></h3>
      <p>
	The julia software package <a href="https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/CoxHomotopies/">CoxHomotopies.jl</a> implements numerical homotopy algorithms described in the research article <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0219498824500737"><em>"Polyhedral Homotopies in Cox Coordinates"</em></a>. We briefly describe numerical homotopy algorithms in general, and the methods contained in this software package.
	<br>
	<br>
	A numerical homotopy algorithm utilizes a <em>start system</em> whose solutions are known or easier to compute to compute solutions of other systems. To compute solutions of a given <em>target system</em>, <em>F</em>, a <em>homotopy</em> is constructed, which can be considered as a path between the start system <em>G</em> and the target system <em>F</em>. A numerical homotopy algorithm <em>tracks</em> the solutions of the start system along the homotopy, to obtain solutions of the target system. In the illustration below, the start system <em>G</em> has 3 solutions that get tracked to 2 solutions of the system <em>F</em>.
      </p>
      <div style="display:block; text-align:center; padding-bottom:20px">
	<img class="staticImg" src="images/homotopyImage.png" alt="Image not found!">
	<br>
	<div style="display:inline-block; text-align:left; width:450px; font-size:14pt">
	  Figure 2: An illustration of a homotopy between a start system <em>G</em> and a target system <em>F</em>.
	</div>
      </div>
      <p>
	Note that in the illustration above, the red curve seems to diverge--it does not provide a solution to the target system <em>F</em>. Alternatively, the red curve could end at a solution of the target system <em>F</em> which is very large in magnitude. In either case, accurately tracking along the red path is computationally expensive and potentially leads to inaccurate or unnecessary information. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The main method of CoxHomotopies.jl provides a numerical homotopy algorithm for solving polynomial systems. Loosely, this algorithm ensures no paths diverge as in the illustration above. This is achieved through a toric compactification of the solution space--solutions are tracked in a quasi-affine space which provides coordinates for the toric compactification via the Cox quotient construction of a complete normal toric variety.

In each graph, the dotted lines represent a random choice of hyperparameters, the dashed red line represents the average condition number for these random choices, and the blue line represents the achieved condition number through the use of the Cox homotopy algorithm.

      <p>
	This algorithm has the additional benefit that extra hyperparameters are introduced during tracking. Numerical experiments detailed in <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0219498824500737"><em>"Polyhedral Homotopies in Cox Coordinates"</em></a> illustrate that these parameters may be chosen in a consistent way as to decrease the condition number of the Jacobian of the system while tracking. This is expressed by the figures above.

      <h3><u>Solving Decomposable Systems in Macaulay2</u></h3>
      <p>
	The Macaulay2 package <a href="https://macaulay2.com/doc/Macaulay2/share/doc/Macaulay2/DecomposableSparseSystems/html/index.html">DecomposableSparseSystems.m2</a> implements methods of decomposing sparse polynomial systems into simpler systems. The article <a href="https://msp.org/jsag/2021/11-1/p06.xhtml"><em>"Decomposable Sparse Polynomial Systems"</em></a> details the methods contained in this package, and the <em>Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry</em> has peer-reviewed the code and documentation in addition to this article.
	<br>
	<br>
	Whether or not a sparse polynomial system decomposes can be determined by its Galois group, as described in the research article <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11075-020-01045-x"><em>"Solving Decomposable Sparse Systems"</em></a>. While the Galois group may be difficult to determine, theoretical tools for understanding the Galois group provide a classification of those systems which decompose. Those sparse polynomial systems that decompose are those <em>lacunary</em> systems and <em>triangular</em> systems. 
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>A lacunary system generalizes equations such as x<sup>6</sup> + 3x<sup>3</sup> + 2 = 0, which may be considered equations in a new variable. If y = x<sup>3</sup>, we may write this equation as the system y<sup>2</sup> + 3y + 2 = 0, x<sup>2</sup> - y = 0.</li>
	<li>A triangular system generalizes triangular linear systems of equations such as 2x + y = 3, 3y = 6, in which a subset of the variables can be solved for independently of the others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	The main method of DecomposableSparseSystems.m2 iteratively decomposes systems until no further decomposition is possible. This is provided as overhead for a black-box solver, which solves the resulting decomposed systems, and the method recombines solutions into solutions of the original system. The figure below shows the results of a computational experiment comparing the timing of using the black-box solver PHCPack agains the main method of DecomposableSparseSystems.m2, in the precense of decomposable systems.
