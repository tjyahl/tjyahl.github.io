			  Algebra and geometry are increasingly popular tools to develop new techniques for applications. Such techniques have found success in numerous fields including chemical and biological reaction networks, robotics and kinematics, statistics and data science, and economics. This session features speakers on advances in the theory of algebraic techniques as well as practitioners throughout math, science, and industry. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  There will be ### sessions consisting of ### talks. Each talk will be 20 minutes long with 5 minutes for questions and 5 minutes for speakers to set up for their presentation.
