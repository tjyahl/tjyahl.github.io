<div style="margin-left:20px"><ul><li>Quick, efficient, didn't require us to stay if we were done</li><li>He was always super helpful, specially whenever we didnt understand the math.</li><li>Very helpful when asked questions </li><li>Hen understood the material very well and explained things in great detail that was easy to understand.</li><li>He had neat handwritten during all recitations and explained topics well.</li><li>My TA was very relatable and really wanted to help us learn the material as opposed to some TA's that I have had thus far. </li><li>He reinforced the idea we learned about in class and helped us in lab with python to the best of his ability.</li><li>Besides being a super charming teacher, he also explained things in a concise manner that was easily understood.</li><li>very smart and very good at explaining concepts</li><li>He was chill.</li><li>Great to talk to and listen to</li><li>clear speech, helpful, flexible</li><li>He genuinely cared about what we were doing and making sure we learned the material well.</li><li>He didn't want to waste anyone's time, and only kept teaching as it was necessary.</li><li>Patient, helpful, knowledgeable</li><li>He was friendly and answered any and all questions in a clear and thorough manner. </li></ul></div>


Please comment about the course: What would you keep the same? What would you change?
<div style="margin-left:20px"><ul><li>glazed over some things</li><li>He just like Aurispa was always open to questions.</li><li>none</li><li>Sometimes he skipped a few steps when he worked out problems.</li><li>N/A</li><li>This question is hard for me to answer, I don't think I disliked anything about him or the way he ran things.</li><li>none</li><li>N/A.</li><li>He is very funny</li><li>n/a</li><li>He wasn't as good with python</li><li>The way he solved out certain problems could be confusing at first glance, because he would skip some steps and do them in his head, but if you knew the material you knew what and why he was skipping certain steps.</li><li>Nothing</li><li>Nothing. He’s one of the best TAs I’ve ever had. </li></ul></div>


Do you recommend your instructor? Why or why not?
<div style="margin-left:20px"><ul><li>jupyter sucks, but not the TA's fault</li><li>very effective</li><li>Very useful</li><li>Did not really benefit my learning experience</li><li>The online labs did not help me learn the material in any way.</li><li>I enjoyed getting to gain some experience using Python during lab. The online homework system was very beneficial to my practice and mastering material. </li><li>Useful because being able to understand something in python makes it useful applied outside of technology.</li><li>The only way I think this class could have been better is if the labs were more applicable rather than just "calculate the ____ of a series of...". Maybe make the problems a little easier in the math, but give the students situations in which they have to recognize what to apply (learned over the last week in class, as is already the procedure), and apply it to solve the problem at hand. IE- give a scenario and don't specifically tell the student to find the sum of series, let them figure out how to apply it themselves.    Other than that, the class had me tie together my knowledge of math and python, which was pretty cool I guess.</li><li>It was alright.</li><li>No use of technology.</li><li>We never used it</li><li>computers used for lab weren't always cooperative</li><li>It was alright</li><li>No technology, besides computers were really used in this class, and only for coding.</li><li>pretty good</li><li>He was very effective. He came to lab and recitation prepared and ready to answer any question I had about the lab and the course in general. </li></ul></div>


Please comment on the book, help session and week-in review as it pertains to your course.
<div style="margin-left:20px"><ul><li>recitation yes  Lab, not really. I didn't really learn how to use any new python tools, just stumble through making them work.</li><li>Not really but I learned how to code math into python.</li><li>Recitation was helpful, I do not see a need for lab besides busy work, the lab did not help me understand the concepts better</li><li>Yes, mainly the recitation because it held me responsible for understanding the material in order to perform well on the quizzes.  The lab was not helpful at all in understanding the material</li><li>No, the labs did not help at all, but the recitations offered a nice review of the material.</li><li>Lab and recitation gave me more exposure to the difficult concepts learned in calculus. I found them very helpful in applying what we had learned in lecture. </li><li>Yes</li><li>I wouldn't say it enhanced it. It felt like another side job I had to worry about using knowledge I had learned in class. It definitely kept math more relevant in my mind throughout the weeks although, instead of only thinking about math during class and when studying for class, I also had to make sure to stay prepared for the weekly exams and labs.</li><li>yes</li><li>No opinion.</li><li>Not really</li><li>Lab did not but recitation is a nice clarifier</li><li>Yes, it helped him going over other problems in recitation</li><li>Doing python labs helped me familiarize myself with a coding language I had never learned before.</li><li>yes</li><li>Yes. </li></ul></div>


Please comment on the use, if any, of technology (computers, graphing calculators, online homework system, etc.) in this course:<br>What would you keep the same? What would you change?
<div style="margin-left:20px"><ul><li>Because he is very helpful, this was the polar experience I had last semester.</li><li>No complaints, very helpful</li><li>He understood the material very well and taught it effectively.  He was also funny</li><li>He was always willing to answer any questions we asked him in person or through email, and he was always prepared for class.</li><li>Thomas was great!! He was always prepared, truly wanted to help, and always graded fairly. </li><li>He knew what he was doing and always seemed to be in a good mood. He seemed to really enjoy what he was teaching.</li><li>Super concise, respectful teacher whose mini-lectures are easy to understand. Great for recitations and labs, and super helpful if you need/utilize his assistance!</li><li>very helpful and very smart</li><li>He's lenient and pretty good at explaining concepts of Calculus 2.</li><li>Great at teaching the material to young college students</li><li>He enjoyed math and was eager to help us understand the concepts and seemed highly knowledgable in the field.</li><li>If you know your stuff before class, the extra work he does on the board is helpful and clears up any misconceptions you may have had.</li><li>very nice, patient, knows the materials, very helpful during lab</li><li>He’s an amazing person who knows his stuff and comes prepared for every lab</li></ul></div>
